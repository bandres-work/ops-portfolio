# Ops Portfolio — Brian Guzmán

This repository contains a set of operations-focused systems designed to demonstrate structured decision-making, operational control, and risk-aware execution.

The focus of this portfolio is not task execution or tooling, but how operational problems are analyzed, prioritized, and resolved through explicit systems and decision frameworks.

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Prioritization based on defined criteria rather than intuition
- Operational visibility through metrics tied to decisions
- Automation reliability and failure recovery
- End-to-end operational system design for real-world scenarios

Each project emphasizes clarity, control, and justification of decisions.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Operations Control & Prioritization System
A structured intake and scoring system that enforces consistent prioritization decisions using impact, urgency, and risk criteria.

Focus:
- Decision logic
- Trade-off justification
- Controlled execution

📁 `/01_operations-control-prioritization`

---

### 2. Automation Failure & Recovery System
A framework to identify, classify, detect, and recover from automation failures, including silent failures.

Focus:
- Failure detection signals
- Recovery playbooks
- Incident visibility

📁 `/02_automation-failure-recovery`

---

### 3. Ops Metrics & Decision Dashboard
A decision-oriented metrics system where each metric is explicitly tied to an operational action.

Focus:
- Threshold-based decisions
- Bottleneck identification
- Process control

📁 `/03_ops-metrics-dashboard`

---

### 4. La Lujaneta — Event Ops System (Real Use Case)
A real-world event operations system designed to manage registration, verification, and on-site decision-making.

Focus:
- Risk reduction
- Operational coordination
- Real usage constraints

📁 `/04_lujaneta-event-ops`

---

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each project folder contains:
- A project-specific README explaining the problem, system design, and decisions
- Supporting documentation (models, rules, diagrams)
- Sample or simulated data where applicable

This repository is intended to be read, not executed.
